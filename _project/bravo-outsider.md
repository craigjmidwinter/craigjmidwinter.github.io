Bravo Outsider is a static website I developed for my video podcast, built with Next.js and TypeScript and deployed on GitHub Pages. The content management is uniquely handled through a YouTube playlist, and the site features VR versions of podcast episodes using WebXR and Three.js React Fiber.

- Built an innovative VR feature for podcast episodes using WebXR and Three.js React Fiber, enhancing user engagement with immersive experiences.
- Developed a custom parsing algorithm to encode/decode meta information from video descriptions using emoji strings, enabling dynamic generation of VR experiences.
- Implemented a content management system that automatically updates the site based on a YouTube playlist, streamlining the process of adding new episodes.
