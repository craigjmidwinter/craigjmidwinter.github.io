ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Craig!

I'm currently Director of Engineering at Hypergiant/Accelint. Prior to that I've held various of engineering roles, leading a variety both frontend and backend projects ranging from building tools for Model Operations in the AI/ML space, to command and control software geared towards visualizing and acting upon geospatial data.

As a leader I believe that creating high-performing teams means building a foundation of trust and transparency. Creating space for risk-taking and learning from failure is key to fostering a culture of innovation and growth.

As an engineer, I love diving into complex problem domains. I've worked all over the stack but my heart lives in the backend transforming data and getting my hands dirty with integrations and infrastructure.

In my spare time I host a podcast called Bravo Outsider where we look at The Real Housewives and other Bravo reality TV shows from an artistic lens.
