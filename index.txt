#RHOSLC #bravotv #bravo #realitytv #RealHousewives.e:T119c,
Whether you‚Äôre researching smart bulbs or exploring the capabilities of your new voice assistant, you‚Äôve probably encountered the terms Smart Home and Home Automation, and you‚Äôve got yourself wondering, is there a difference?

While these two terms are sometimes used interchangeably and are closely related, they actually refer to slightly different things.

The term Smart Home generally refers to a class of electronic devices and sensors that can be controlled over the internet (or your local network) via your phone, computer or other devices. These devices will often have their own separate app or interface that you would use in order to control devices within certain ecosystem‚Äì for example Philips Hue smart-bulbs are Smart Home devices, and the manufacturer maintains their own app which you can use in order to control the devices within the Philips Hue ecosystem.

Home Automation, on the other hand, refers more to a methodology for using Smart Home devices. The idea behind Home Automation is to make these devices work automatically, responding to what you are doing while requiring little-to-no interaction with any sort of app or physical interface.

For example, let‚Äôs say you may have Philips Hue smart bulbs, and when you watch movies you like to have them all set up in a certain ‚Äòscene‚Äô (scene is general purpose term that refers to the a bunch of smart home devices set to a specific state). General smart-home use would be opening up the app on your phone and then pressing the button for the corresponding scene and then starting your movie‚Äì and then when you stop (or press pause) opening up the app again and pressing the button for the scene that you want to go back to. If you are into home automation, you would set up an automation that detected when a movie started playing and then automatically adjusted your lights to your ‚Äòmovie scene‚Äô and then turned them back to normal when you pause or stop.

You can easily have smart home devices without doing any sort of home automation (but what‚Äôs the fun in that?) but it is very difficult to do any sort of home automation without some sort of smart home device.

To confuse matters more, often some smart home devices will have some home automation features built right into their core functionality‚Äì like the Nest thermostat, for example, automatically adjusts your temperature depending on whether it thinks you are home or away.

But built-in home automation features are not the only (and often not even the best) way to accomplish this functionality. Most home-automation enthusiasts will use some sort of hub software that serves as a middle-man to allow various devices and ecosystems to talk to each other and to use various small pieces of information from one another and combine this information to assemble the context it needs in order to better respond to more complex scenarios than any single set of devices can on their own. Hub software like this also has the added benefit of being a single point of control so that you can control all of the smart devices in your house without having to use a bunch of different apps for each device.

There are many options for what to use as your Hub. The two big free open source options are Home Assistant and OpenHAB. I have used both, and I think both projects are great and have very excellent communities. My personal day-to-day is Home Assistant, but definitely give both a try to see which has the best support for your devices and which interface you like best. These two are by no means the only options, there are a variety of other projects and also some paid options that might be worth considering depending on your requirements.

Some users are happy to just cobble together some automations using IFTTT (though, personally, I find the service really slow and a bit unreliable), but others might strive to see how deep the rabbit hole goes.

Home Automation is an excellent hobby if you like learn and problem solve. The key is being able to build fun and innovative automations is being able to identify problems, processes and systems in your day-to-day life and find ways to optimize them by breaking them down into smaller, more workable problems that can be solved. All you need to get in to it is a willingness to learn and spend time and money on stupid shit (and it definitely helps if you have a patient partner who doesn‚Äôt get too upset when you test out your new sunrise automation without giving them any warning).
f:Tfe5,
So, recently I decided to step my game up with my audio notifications for my home automation setup. I‚Äôm in the process of slowly redoing some of my YAML automations in Node-RED, and I thought what better of a time to make some improvements.

Up until recently I had been just using the built-in Home Assistant tts.google_say service to create whatever message I needed and then piping that over my whole home audio when I needed. It‚Äôs reliable and gets the job done just fine, but it‚Äôs very robotic and I wanted a voice with personality and confidence.

So, naturally, I went on Fiverr.

After some searching and listening to a lot of different samples I came across a gig from a guy named Uni V Sol who had a very impressive demo reel.

![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Iz0qAC7ymo)

Perfect. If major brands like Nike, Pepsi and AT&T trusted him to deliver their important messages, I‚Äôm sure I could trust him to deliver important notifications about my cat‚Äôs litter box being full.

So, I bought 50 words worth and sent him a list of notifications.

How did they turn out? Have a listen to my new cat litter notification:

It was super affordable and I‚Äôm really happy with how they turned out. I‚Äôll definitely be ordering from him again once I‚Äôve got another batch of notifications ready. [(Check out his fiverr gig here)](https://www.fiverr.com/univsolmc/record-an-urban-male-voice-over)

Now that I‚Äôve got my fancy new notifications, let‚Äôs put them to use

I don‚Äôt really care about if these go off when I‚Äôm not home, but I don‚Äôt want them to go off while the house is in ‚ÄòNight Mode‚Äô and wake us up. Since I‚Äôve got more than a few notifications that need to be handled in the same way I decided to create a reusable sub-flow that I could just pass messages into from other flows.

The first node there is the entry point‚Äì every flow that is going to pass this flow a message is going to have a corresponding node that is the other side of the virtual wire. This is where the messages come in.

The way that I‚Äôve configure this to work is that incoming messages should all have a property on the message named file that is set to the url of the file we want to play, so we‚Äôll always send a message where msg.file = ‚Äúhttps://server/our-notification.mp3.

It‚Äôs important to note that I set this on the message object directly and not as part of the payload. The reason that I do that is because the Home Assistant Node-RED nodes trample over the data in the payload, so setting it directly on the msg object makes it easier to persist from node to node.

From there I check the state of an input_boolean that I have set up in HASS that indicates whether or not the house is in ‚ÄúNight Mode‚Äù. In my setup, this entity is basically Do Not Disturb mode. This node has a ‚Äúhalf if state‚Äù set to on, and so if any messages come in while we‚Äôre in night mode, we just ignore them.

After that it‚Äôs fairly self-explanatory‚Äì First it sets the volume of my everywhere media_player group, and then there are two different pairs of nodes that prep a the payload with a sound file, in the set it preps and plays a small blank sound file and then in the second set it preps and plays the notification file I need.

The reason for the blank spacer is because for reasons that still remain a mystery to me, often when Home Assistant tries to play an audio file and it hasn‚Äôt yet taken control of the chromecast group, I can hear the chime indicating that HASS has connected, but the audio fails to play. If it‚Äôs followed by audio in the next few minutes while HASS still has control, it plays without a hitch, so I‚Äôve got this little blank file in there to make it work more smoothly. If you know why it does this or have a fix for it, please let me know in the comments!

And that about does it for this
flow! [If you want to check out how I‚Äôve set up my cat litter notification, check out this post](/blog/2018-06-automatic-litterbox-notifications-using-an-home-assistant-and-node-red-with-an-external-rest-api/)!
10:T16f3,
Cleaning the cat litter‚Äì it‚Äôs the job the whole household fights over. Nothing is quite as glamourous as scooping shit out of a box in a dark corner of the basement.

It‚Äôs always these undesirable tasks that I end up putting off and forgetting about. The thing about the cat litter is that it‚Äôs a lot less of a pain in the ass to clean if you stay on top of it. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs my chore and I don‚Äôt always stay on top of it as well as I probably should- it‚Äôs not uncommon for Jess to notice that it‚Äôs getting a bit too full even though I feel like I have just cleaned it.

In any event, I wanted a solution to take the guess-work out of it and to give me a reminder when it‚Äôs full. Down the road I was thinking about gamify it and awarding myself badges and maybe keeping a highscore board for cleaning streaks and stuff.

Now, there are a number of ways you can really simply implement something pretty much exactly the same as what I‚Äôve got here using purely Home Assistant (or HASS and Node Red or AppDaemon), but I decided I wanted to create a little external service so I could extend and fuck around with it in the future if I wanted to. I won‚Äôt go into the details of that service but if you‚Äôre really interested, let me know and I can make a post about it in the future.

**So, what does this do?**

Basically, all it consists of is a button near the litter box that I hit after I‚Äôve cleaned the litter box to log the
fact that I‚Äôve cleaned it. It fires a thank you tweet off and logs the cleaning in the microservice. In addition to the
api endpoint for logging the cleaning, it provides a few endpoints to provide some information to my HASS install, the
main one being an litterbox fill percentage that my HASS install uses in a sensor to determine when it should notify me
about needing to be cleaned again. Let‚Äôs look at the Node-Red flow:

[//]: # (![]&#40;/src/images/2018/12/Screenshot-2018-06-24-16.54.22.png)
It looks a little more complicated than it actually is. I tried to group it and lay it out as logically as possible. Let‚Äôs take a look at the top part of the flow

[//]: # (![]&#40;/src/images/2018/12/Screenshot-2018-06-24-16.55.55.png)
The top part of this flow just handles the litter clean button press. When it sees the event in Home Assistant, it uses the HTTP Request node to send a request to the API on the litterbox microservice to log the cleaning, thanks me on twitter, and then waits 20 seconds (I do this here because the sensor we use in Home Assistant only updates every few seconds.) before sending the reset message to the Trigger & Block node.

There is also this daily notification reset, that sends the reset message to the Trigger & Block node once a day.

**What is the trigger and block node and what does it do?**

The trigger and block node is useful node that is helpful for limiting actions that only should be triggered once. Essentially, the first message through it passes through and then locks the door behind it. In order to open the door for more messages to come through, you need to send a message where msg.reset is set. So in this case, we are firing our notification flow the first time that the litter level crosses the threshold and then the door locks. After that, we are unlocking the door once a day to allow another notification through as a reminder and also unlocking it after it gets cleaned.

**Ok, let‚Äôs take a look at the actual notification flow**

[//]: # (![]&#40;/src/images/2018/12/Screenshot-2018-06-24-16.57.10.png)
The main trigger for this part of the flow is checking the litter fill sensor I‚Äôve got set up in Home Assistant. This is a REST sensor and it gets the percentage from my micro service‚Äôs api using an HTTP request. This type of sensor is really handy and has really limitless potential since you can use it to get any sort of data from any external REST API that you‚Äôve got access to and use a template to read the data you want to use. This is what the configuration for my sensor looks like in my Home Assistant config

```yaml
    - platform: rest
      name: litter_percent
      unit_of_measurement: '%'
      resource: http://litterboxservice.local/catlitter/litter-percent
      icon_template: '{% if states.sensor.litter_percent.state|default(0)|int >= 75 %}mdi:emoticon-poop{% else %}mdi:cat{% endif %}'
```

Now that we‚Äôre getting the data we want, let‚Äôs look at the notifications.

So, I get these notifications in two ways. The first way I receive it is through a voice notification in the house. To
accomplish this, I just send a formatted message to
my [voice notification sub-flow that I covered in this previous post.](/blog/2018-06-i-hired-a-dude-who-voices-nike-commercials-to-tell-me-when-my-cat-litter-is-full/)

The second way I get these notifications is through twitter, and in this case I also attach a photo of the dirty litter box just for some added shaming. I‚Äôve got a camera set up down there and a little script runs that keeps an snapshot stored on my HASS server. I‚Äôve noticed that the night-vision images are pretty gross, so I‚Äôve got a little flow that checks if the lights are on down there and if they are off it will turn the lights in the basement on for a bit so that the snapshot is better lit before it sends it.

The actual fill percentage isn‚Äôt based on anything but time since the last cleaning‚Äì for now, this is pretty effective but down the road I‚Äôm considering adding some load sensors to the bottom of the litter boxes in order to detect when the cats actually visit the boxes and using the number of visits since the last cleaning for this value. I‚Äôm also considering only tweeting the photo of the full litter box if I haven‚Äôt cleaned it after the first notification.

If you‚Äôve got any questions or improvements that you want to suggest, leave me a comment!
